# Journey Of Artus

You are a boy living in a small village called Haztan. Your family are mostly farmers or shopkeepers. One day, the rogue king catches fire to Haztan, turning the village to ruins.

You later wake up feeling dizzy and confused, when you notice a robed figure saying something you can't understand. Suddenly, everything goes dark and cold. You see a small light that has a blue tint, you walk towards it and suddenly hear a high-pitched ringing.

Yet again you wake up, but this time you are in your house. Everything looks just like it was before the king went rogue. Your job is to stop the rogue king from destroying your village, whatever it takes, you must do it.
